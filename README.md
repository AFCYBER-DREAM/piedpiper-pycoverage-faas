Setup.cfg tells the tools which package to analyze by specifying the package name after the command line switch --cov=
The .coveragerc file is the configuration file used by coverage.py. Most options are shown and documented in the test.zip, however for full documentation reference the website https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html
